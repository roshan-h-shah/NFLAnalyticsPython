Analysis: Overall, Gradient Boosting Regression performed the most accurate with a mean squared error of 43.323. While the error seems relatively large, some of this is due to the unpredictability of sports. Thus, even with a seemingly large mean squared error, the model proved to be 76.9% accurate in theoretical bets placed using the models prediced passing touchdowns by NFL Quarterbacks in the 2022-2023 season, compared to Vegas Insider's 2022 Prohected Passing Touchdowns. ALthough the sample size was small, n = 26, this regression model seems promising because any model with a more effective succcess rate than 54% is profitable in the world of sports analytics and betting.
Improvements:
Find different regression techniques that could be more effective than Gradient Boositng Regression.
Backtest this data, through a time series split to train the data on many different sets of years, for example data from 2000-2005 could predict the 2006 passing touchdowns, and so forth all the way until data from 2000-2021 predicts the 2022 passing touchdowns. Then a trendline could be created with each mean squared error in each yearly split which when tested could result in a more consistent and better trained model.
Find different methods to webscrape even more advanced statistics, and create metrics to quantify categorical variables, like winds, temperature and oppoinent.
